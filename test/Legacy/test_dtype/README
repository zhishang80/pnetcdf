These examples test reading into or writing from noncontiguous memory data
specified by MPI derived datatypes and/or array index mapping.

test_subarray:
	.Test for subarray memory layout
	.Test for collective subarray netcdf access
	.Test for whole array netcdf access
	.Test for mapped subarray netcdf access

test_darray:
	.Test for darray memory layout
	.Test for collective strided subarray netcdf access

TEST CONFIGURATIONS:
	.the tests will run with defaults automatically.
	.edit "test_dtype.h" as described inside.
	.run test with option [-h] or [-help] to get command-line argument help.
	.for more test flexibility, please program the src code by 
	 following the testing logic indicated in the src comments.
