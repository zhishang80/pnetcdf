  o Bug fixes
    * Fix the missing byte-swap required for retrieving user-defined fill
      values. See r2864. This fix is critical when PnetCDF is configured with
      option erange-fill enabled (default mode) and the target platform is a
      Little Endian.
    * Fix test program test/nc_test/test_read.m4 and test/testcases/modes.c for
      testing whether the correct error codes can be returned when opening a
      non-existing file. Thanks to Mark Dixon for testing various MPI
      implementations, compilers, and file systems, we found that when using
      MVAPICH2 2.2, its Lustre driver always adds O_CREAT flag to the open()
      calls. Because of this behavior, the non-existing file will be created
      with zero length, which causes PnetCDF to spew NC_ENOTNC instead of
      NC_ENOENT. A bug report has been filed to MVAPICH. The fix shall come in
      the next release of MVAPICH. The bug report can be found in
      http://mailman.cse.ohio-state.edu/pipermail/mvapich-discuss/2017-February/006300.html
