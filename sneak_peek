    * none

  o New/updated utility program
    * ncvalidator adds a new option -t to turn on tracing mode which prints all
      successfully validated metadata till the first error encountered.
    * ncvalidator adds a check to detect whether there are two or more
      unlimited dimensions defined in the file and, if yes, reports error code
      NC_EUNLIMIT.

  o Other updates:
    * Add a check for NC_EUNLIMIT in API ncmpi_open to detect whether two or
      more unlimited dimensions are defined in a corrupted file.

  o Bug fixes
    * Remove freeing name object because NC_ENULLPAD is not a fatal error. See
      r3644. This bug only appears when --enable-null-byte-header-padding is
      set at configure time and opening files whose headers are not padded with
      null bytes.
    * Member "value" of NC_dimarray, NC_attrarray, and NC_vararray can still be
      NULL when a corrupted tag of NC_DIMENSION, NC_ATTRIBUTE, or NC_VARIABLE
      is read from files. Add a check against NULL before freeing it. This bug
      only appears when reading files with corruptted NC tags. See r3645.

  o New example programs
    * none

  o New programs for I/O benchmarks
    * none

  o New test program

    * src/utils/ncvalidator/tst_open.c - tests API ncmpi_open against corrupted
      files and checks expected error codes.
